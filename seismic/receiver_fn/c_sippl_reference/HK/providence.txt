Hi Alexei (et al.),


after some successful hard disc archaeology, I put the source code of the HK-Stacking routine I used here:

ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/incoming/sippl-20170516/HK.tar.gz

The main code and makefiles are in the folder Rf_hk, there is also some matlab-based plotting stuff that I never used in PLOT_FUNCTIONS. Hope that it is no problem to get it to compile at your end...

Note that the code is not mine, so you should refer to this publication here where the principle is described:

Chen, Y., Niu, F., Liu, R., Huang, Z., Tkalcic, H., Sun, L., and Chan, W. ( 2010), Crustal structure beneath China from receiver function analysis, J. Geophys. Res., 115, B03307, doi:10.1029/2009JB006386.

Cheers,

Christian
