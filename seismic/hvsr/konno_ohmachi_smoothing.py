    Smoothing with the "Konno-Ohmachi" function

    W(f) = (sin(bexp*log10(f/fc)) / (bexp*log10(f/fc)))^4,

    \a bexp determines the exponent 10^(2.5/exp) which is the half-width of
    the peak.

    Calculates a len(frequencies) x len(frequencies) matrix with the Konno &

    Any spectrum with the same frequency bins as this matrix can later be
    smoothed by a simple matrix multiplication with this matrix:
        smoothed_spectrum = np.dot(spectrum, smoothing_matrix)

    This also works for many spectra stored in one large matrix and is even
    more efficient.

    This makes it very efficient for smoothing the same spectra again and again
    but it comes with a high memory consumption for larger frequenciy arrays!
