Machine-learning classifier for seismic P and S wave arrivals

data.py: methods that return iterators that may be used with Keras to feed
data to the neural network for training. Uses a pre-processed training set
stored on NCI.

datagenerator.py: defines a class that inherits the Keras 'Sequence' class,
used for the generators returned by data.py

main.py: trains and tests the neural network using the pre-processed ISC
dataset on NCI

misclassification-analysis.py: takes the test partition of the ISC dataset
and saves plots of correctly and incorrectly classified waveforms to
corresponding subdirectories for qualitative analysis of results

model.py: defines the structure and hyperparameters of the neural network
algorithm in Keras

scoreClassifier.py: computes precision and recall for S waves, P waves and
noise in the ISC test dataset.

shakenet-model.hdf5: pretrained weights from the ISC teleseismic dataset. Used
by the test scripts.
