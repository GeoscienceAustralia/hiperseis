    Apply quality curation criteria to a stream. Modifies the stream in-place if required. Traces in stream
    must be in ZNE order. Each trace in the stream is expected to have metadata with starttime, endtime,
    channel and inclination.

    The following checks are made. If any of these checks fails, the function returns False:
    * Inclination value is not NaN
    * The stream has 3 channels
    * Each trace in the stream has the same number of samples
    * None of the traces have any NaN values in the time series data
    * None of the traces have zero variance

    The following cleanups are attempted on the stream:
    * All 3 traces have the same time range
