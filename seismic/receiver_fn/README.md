# Receiver Function (RF) tools

## [Dependencies](../README.md#Dependencies)

## Workflow

The RF workflow is based on the following main steps:

1. Data preparation: extract raw waveforms in time windows associated with selected seismic
   events from ASDF database for the deployment
2. Calculate Receiver Functions: rotation (ZRT/QLT) and deconvolution
3. Quality filtering on RFs: discard bad results by filtering
4. Perform analysis such as 1D Earth structure inversion, H-k stacking, etc.

There are a number of manuals and literature about RF. You can refer to examples provided by
[Charles Ammon](http://eqseis.geosc.psu.edu/~cammon/HTML/RftnDocs/rftn01.html), manuals
distributed with [python RF libraries](https://rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [chapter 4.1 of
Tom Richter's dissertation](http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDISS_derivate_000000014929/dissertation_richter.pdf).

The work in this module utilizes the RF framework developed in the Python [`rf` library
developed by Tom Eulenfeld](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01808).


## [1. Event Trace Extraction](../README.md#Event Trace Extraction)

## 2. Receiver Function Calculation / Correction

The `generate_rf.py` script reads the event traces  produced by `extract_event_traces.py` 
and generates receiver functions. The script parallelizes RF computation over stations 
through MPI.  

For usage details, see output of `python generate_rf.py --help` below:

```
Usage: generate_rf.py [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE
  
  INPUT_FILE : Input waveforms in H5 format
               (output of extract_event_traces.py)

  OUTPUT_FILE : Output H5 file name

Options:
  --network-list TEXT  A space-separated list of networks (within quotes) to
                       process.  [default: *]

  --station-list TEXT  A space-separated list of stations (within quotes) to
                       process.  [default: *]

  --config-file FILE   Run configuration file in JSON format
  --only-corrections   Compute and apply corrections for stations listed under
                       'correction' in the input json config file -- all other
                       stations are ignored. Note that preexisting data (for
                       relevant channels, if present) are deleted before
                       saving the corrections  [default: False]

  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

Run configuration files consist of 3 sub-dictionaries. One named `filtering` for
input stream filtering settings, one named `processing` for RF processing
settings, and one named `correction` for rotating / swapping / negating channel
data for one or more named stations with potential orientation discrepancies.
Each of these sub-dicts is described below:

```
        "filtering":  # Filtering settings
        {
          "resample_rate": float # Resampling rate in Hz
          "taper_limit": float   # Fraction of signal to taper at end, between 0 and 0.5
          "filter_band": (float, float) # Filter pass band (Hz). Not required for freq-domain deconvolution.
          "channel_pattern": # Ordered list of preferred channels, e.g. 'HH*,BH*',
                             # where channel selection is ambiguous.
          "baz_range": (float, float) or [(float, float), ...] # Discrete ranges of source back azimuth to use (degrees).
              # Each value must be between 0 and 360. May be a pair or a list of pairs for multiple ranges.
        }

        "processing":  # RF processing settings
        {
          "custom_preproc":
          {
            "import": 'import custom symbols',  # statement to import required symbols
            "func": 'preproc functor'  # expression to get handle to custom preprocessing functor
            "args": {}  # additional kwargs to pass to func
          }
          "trim_start_time": float # Trace trim start time in sec, relative to onset
          "trim_end_time": float # Trace trim end time in sec, relative to onset
          "rotation_type": str # Choice of ['zrt', 'lqt']. Rotational coordinate system
                               # for aligning ZNE trace components with incident wave direction
          "deconv_domain": str # Choice of ['time', 'freq', 'iter']. Whether to perform deconvolution
                               # in time or freq domain, or iterative technique
          "gauss_width": float # Gaussian freq domain filter width. Only required for freq-domain deconvolution
          "water_level": float # Water-level for freq domain spectrum. Only required for freq-domain deconvolution
          "spiking": float # Spiking factor (noise suppression), only required for time-domain deconvolution
          "normalize": bool # Whether to normalize RF amplitude
        }

        "correction": # corrections to be applied to data for named stations prior to RF computation
        {
          "plot_dir": str # path to folder where plots related to cahnnel rotations are to be saved
          "swap_ne": list # list of NET.STA.LOC for which N and E channels are to be swapped, e.g ["OA.BL27."],
          "rotate": list # list of NET.STA.LOC that are to be rotated to maximize P-arrival energy on \
                           the primary RF component, e.g ["OA.BL27."]
          "negate": list # list of NET.STA.LOC.CHA that are to be negated, e.g ["OA.BL27..HHZ"]
        }       
```
Default values for parameters in "filtering" and "processing", above, are drawn from the list below:

```
     DEFAULT_RESAMPLE_RATE_HZ = 20.0
     DEFAULT_FILTER_BAND_HZ = (0.02, 1.00)
     DEFAULT_TAPER_LIMIT = 0.05
     DEFAULT_TRIM_START_TIME_SEC = -50.0
     DEFAULT_TRIM_END_TIME_SEC = 150.0
     DEFAULT_ROTATION_TYPE = 'zrt'   # from ['zrt', 'lqt']
     DEFAULT_DECONV_DOMAIN = 'time'  # from ['time', 'freq', 'iter']
     DEFAULT_GAUSS_WIDTH = 1.0
     DEFAULT_WATER_LEVEL = 0.01
     DEFAULT_SPIKING = 0.5
     RAW_RESAMPLE_RATE_HZ = 20.0
     BANDPASS_FILTER_ORDER = 2        
```

The default parameters are somewhat tuned to BH* instrument response waveforms, and should be 
explored during a RF study. 

During RF generation, some problematic traces are removed that would be
fatal for RF generation, as follows:
1. Remove traces with invalid inclination value in the metadata (e.g. NaN).
2. Remove traces in which not all ZNE channels are present for a given event.
3. Remove traces in which the number of samples in the Z, N and E channels are not the same.
4. Remove traces in which NaN is found in the data.
5. Remove traces with zero variance in the data.
6. Remove traces for which an exception is caught during RF generation.
7. Remove traces with empty channel data or channels missing after deconvolution.

### Typical Usage:

Compute RFs in parallel:

```
mpirun -np NUM_PROCS python generate_rf.py OA_waveforms.h5  OA_rf.h5 \
--config-file config_rfs.json
```

config_rfs.json:
```
{
  "filtering": {
    "resample_rate": 10.0,
    "taper_limit": 0.05,
    "filter_band": [0.02, 1.0]
  },
  "processing": {
      "rotation_type": "ZRT",
      "deconv_domain": "iter",
      "normalize": true
  }
}
```

#### Correcting RFs

A small percentage of stations in some networks (e.g. OA) suffer from channel orientation 
problems. Those stations can be corrected through a combination of channel rotation, negation 
or swapping (N/E). Typically, one would generate the RFs and visualize them as described in 
[Visualization of RFs](#visualization-of-rfs) -- note that the
[RF Quality Filtering](#rf-quality-filtering) step can be skipped for the corrections and 
completed afterwards. A pdf report generated as described in
[Visualization of RFs](#visualization-of-rfs) helps identify stations with orientation problems.
Once a list of problematic stations is compiled, users need to run `generate_rf.py` with the same
input/output parameters, but with a `correction` block added to the json configuration file, as 
follows:

config_rfs.json:
```
{
  "filtering": {
    "resample_rate": 10.0,
    "taper_limit": 0.05,
    "filter_band": [0.02, 1.0]
  },
  "processing": {
      "rotation_type": "ZRT",
      "deconv_domain": "time",
      "normalize": true
  }
  "correction":{
      "plot_dir":"path/to/plots",
      "swap_ne":["OA.BL27.", "OA.BM31."]
      "rotate":["OA.BL27.", "OA.BM31."]
      "negate":["OA.CA21.", "OA.CB31."]
  }
}
```
Note that the correction step should be run with the `--only-corrections` flag, as follows:

```
mpirun -np NUM_PROCS python generate_rf.py OA_waveforms.h5  OA_rf.h5 \
--config-file config_rfs.json --only-corrections
```
The above will ensure that only those stations in the `correction` block are processed. Plots 
showing effects of channel rotation (if specified) are saved in the `path/to/plots` folder, 
along with a json file listing corrections to back-azimuths. Note that when back-azimuths 
are updated, the original back-azimuths are stored in the trace-header as `orig_back_azimuth`.

Correcting orientation problems is an iterative process that may require different combinations 
of rotation, channel swapping and negation for problematic stations -- consequently, the 
`correction` block may need to be updated, RFs generated and visualized, iteratively, to correct 
all problematic stations. To speed up the correction process, one can use time-domain
deconvolution, which is much faster than iterative deconvolution -- once optimal corrections 
are found for all problematic stations, one can then revert to iterative deconvolution 
to regenerate RFs for problematic stations.

## 3. RF Quality Filtering

Usually the RFs produced by component rotation and deconvolution are not all useful for stacking,
and further quality metrics and quality filtering must be considered. The are a family of approaches
available and this is an area of active research. Consequently, rather than applying a fixed set of
RF quality filters, the approach taken here is to directly apply only the most simple and trusted
of filters to remove some RFS (such as when a signal is all zero), and then compute a range of
quality metrics and store them in the RF metadata.  This way, the actual filtering of the RFs by
quality criteria is deferred until later visualization and analysis, allowing greater choice and
flexibility in the analysis stage. For example, the quality metadata stored in each RF is used by the reporting
script `bulk_rf_report.py` (see below) to offer two fairly well established means of filtering RF
quality, and the user has a choice of which ones to apply when producing the report. This deferred
approach to RF quality filtering is also intended to readily support new machine learning approaches
to RF quality classification.

The script for applying RF quality metrics is `rf_quality_filter.py`.
The following filters are applied directly and immediately in this script to remove spurious RFs:
1. Remove traces containing NaNs
2. Remove traces containing 1 or less sample in the trace
3. Remove traces whose number of samples is not as expected. The expected number is the statistical _mode_
   of the number of samples across all traces in the stream.

Then the following additional metrics are computed on each RF and stored in the RF trace metadata. See source code
documentation for additional details:
1. Signal-to-noise ratio
2. Spectral entropy
3. Max amplitude and RMS amplitude of the RF component, and the same from the Z-component stored in the R and T components
4. Base 10 logarithms of the max and RMS amplitude metrics
5. Spectral and histogram statistics
6. Ratios of statistics before and after onset
7. Statistical moments of the RF frequency spectrum
8. Coherence of signals in the frequency domain
9. Grouping by similarity (DBSCAN method)

Finally, when saving the traces with quality metrics in the metadata, the Z-component is dropped to
reduce file size, so only the R- and T-components are saved.  A diversity of
quality metrics are computed because this is an area of active research.

To use script `rf_quality_filter.py`, the following parameters should be provided:
* H5 Input file name
* H5 Output file name

For additional options, see `rf_quality_filter.py --help`.


## 4. Analyses/Visualization of RFs

Automatic report generation on a full set of RF results is performed using the MPI-parallelized 
`bulk_rf_report.py` script.
This script needs to be provided with an input H5 file containing RFs generated in 
[Receiver Function Calculation](#receiver-function-calculation) or that in 
[RF Quality Filtering](#rf-quality-filtering) and an output file name -- it then generates 
a PDF report containing a standard set of visualisations of the RFs:

* Pinwheel diagram showing RFs source directions around the full azimuthal range
* Stacked RFs for R-component
* Stacked RFs for T-component
* H-k stacking plot based on the stacked R-components
* Estimates of sediment thickness if de-reverberation was applied on a given station

Quality filters can be used to filter out spurious RFs, as described in usage details from 
`bulk_rf_report.py --help`.

Note that, if `bulk_rf_report.py` is run on RFs produced in 
[Receiver Function Calculation](#receiver-function-calculation), `--min-slope-ratio` is 
the only quality-filter available. Otherwise, if run on the output generated in 
[RF Quality Filtering](#rf-quality-filtering), all quality-filters described above 
are available for use. Use of at least one of these options is highly recommended to 
remove spurious RFs.

### Typical Usage
Generate pdf report in parallel:

```
mpirun -np NUM_PROCS python bulk_rf_report.py OA_rf.h5 OA_rf_report.pdf \
--hk-hpf-freq 0.1 --min-slope-ratio 5 --station-list 'CJ27 BV22'
```

### Analysing RFs using Vespagrams

Vespagrams are images of receiver functions ordered by distance or slowness. The character (shape) of the conversion
distribution can indicate if they are direct conversions, such as Pms, or its multiples, such as PpPms or PpSms.
Recommended reading about the application of vespagrams is *Tian et al. GRL 2005 VOL. 32, L08301, doi:10.1029/2004GL021885*.

The tool to plot vespagrams is `rf_plot_vespagram.py` which takes as input a set of RFs stored in H5 format.
See `rf_plot_vespagram.py --help`. Currently the plotting is set from -5 to 20 seconds time window and
5 to 9 s/degrees in slowness. The filtering is bandpass from 0.03 to 0.5 Hz. The parameters of the data processing
are saved within the PDF file _document properties_.


### Plotting Station Maps and Ray Piercing Points

The legacy script `legacy/plot_map.py` draws a station map and piercing points of the receiver functions. This script
is slated to be refactored. This script generates plots with high-resolution topography and automatic adjustment of
the station label positions using the `https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText` library.

Note that general network and station plotting can be found in the `seismic.inventory` module.


### Extraction of RFs for earth model inversion

RFs can be exported from H5 file to special format for RF inversion using the `rf_inversion_export.py` script.
This script takes an input H5 file (which may contain RFs prior to quality filtering since `rf_inversion_export.py`
has some filtering support) and a specified output folder. In the output folder, the script outputs one `.dat`
file per channel per station containing the RF trace amplitude, with moveout, as a function of time at specific
sampling rate of 6.25 Hz.  These `.dat` files are then ready for ingestion into RF inversion Fortran code.


### Models folder

This folder contains miscellaneous earth model files used for RF analysis, such as custom 1D velocity models.


### Legacy code

The `legacy` folder is for legacy code which is retained temporarily for reference purposes, and whose methods
may in future be rolled into the existing RF workflow.
